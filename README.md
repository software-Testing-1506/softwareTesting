# QWordCount
tiny trial with java
a tiny word-count tool,just for trick.

How to use the elegant tiny QC(wc?ok)

+ no -s but directly typing \*.c or anything you like,or just typing * to traversal all the files this dir

+ new -a parameter meaning new function counting codeline,nullline and balaline

+ new -e stoplist and the words containing by the stoplist won't be counted

+ new the output outputs to ouput.txt default but you can design it yourself by -o

+ the word in stoplist should be splited by space if you really want it works

original readme:

  open your cmd and cd to the folder with Conder.exe.
  
  and code in 
  
    Conder.exe [parameter] [input_file_name] [parameter] [output_file_name]
    
  oh,sorry for my transgression.
  
    wc.exe [parameter] [input_file_name] [parameter] [output_file_name]
    
  -c -w -l for parameters before input_file_name and -o before output_file_name
  
  perhaps you want to analyse one more files.it's ok in my program.
  
  you can also output some message into file1 and some into file2.
   
  test it by taking LICENSE as input_file_name or your added new files
   
At last,any questions by sending email to simonqidaa@gmail.com please.
